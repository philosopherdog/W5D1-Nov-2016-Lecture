 ## Swift 3
 
 - In 2014 Apple blew away developers with a surprise announcement that a new programming language called Swift had been secretly under development for 4 years!
 
 - Since being announced Swift has been officially open sourced and has been ported to Linux. This is huge because it makes its use on servers possible.
 
 - Google has been talking about using it to replace Java on Android!
 
 - Swift is still rapidly changing. New versions of Swift are not expected to be source compatible until at least Swift 4. So, this limits its use to apps that are not mission critical.

 ## Playgrounds

 - But Playgrounds are crash prone. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª (üí™üèª set the run option to manual).

 ### Markup in Playgrounds
 
 - You can view markdown (Apple calls it "markup") in Playgrounds using a special syntax. You can find the syntax [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/).
 
 - Toggle between rendering and raw markup using the menu item: `editor > show raw markup` or `editor > show rendered markup`

 #### Types
 - Types are upper cased
 - Instances are lower cased
 - There arre Swift specific foundation types for Int, Double, String, Array, Dictionary, Set, etc.
 - Swift can also easily and seamlessly cast between Swift Foundation types and the old foundation classes
 - Swift has a generic type like `id` called `AnyObject`
 - Swift also has a type `Any` which includes functions
 - You have to cast between them using **as**
 */

 ## Why Optionals Need to be Unwrapped
 - Think of Optionals as a box, just like NSNumber in Objc
 - Just like you cannot do very much with an NSNumber in Objc unless you call `intValue` on it to get the underlying value. So too Optionals can only be used for nil checking without **unwrapping** them
 
 */

/*:
 ### Optional Binding
 - Swift provides convenience syntax for binding an optional to a variable
 */

}

//: **Tip:** The constant we bind it to can be named anything, but always prefer to re-use the initial name

 - `Array` is homogeneous
